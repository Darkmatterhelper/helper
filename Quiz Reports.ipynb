    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quiz Reports** is a Jupyter Notebook and Python application that pulls quiz data from [Canvas LMS](https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms) to create PDF documents containing student answers to *essay questions*. Application requires the following user inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Canvas Instance\n",
    "* Active Canvas Access Token\n",
    "* Course ID\n",
    "* Quiz ID\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.zip` file containing a PDF per student *(who submitted the quiz)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ID** (randomly-generated, anonymous student identifier)\n",
    "* **Course name** (as it appears on Canvas)\n",
    "* **Question text** (as it appears on Canvas)\n",
    "* **Student's response** (all submitted text -- does not preserving formatting)\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: all of the above will repeat for as many questions as are in the quiz (on seperate pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.csv` detailing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Student Name** (as it appears on Canvas)\n",
    "* **Student ID** (UBC student ID)\n",
    "* **Canvas ID** (Canvas LMS ID)\n",
    "* **Anonymous ID** (as it appears in the output PDFs)\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: this table contains sensitive information and should **NOT** be distributed or uploaded anywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only works for “Classic Quizzes” on Canvas (not New Quizzes)\n",
    "* Formatting in the student response is **not** preserved\n",
    "* Will only output questions of type “Essay Question” on Canvas\n",
    "* Tool is designed for a *Final Exam* use case and therefore, **should not be run on Quizzes that allow more than one attempt.** Doing so may cause unexpected and/or unreliable behaviour."
